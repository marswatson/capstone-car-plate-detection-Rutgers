# capstone-car-plate-detection-Rutgers
This is the capstone design project of Rutgers University ECE Department.
There are total three part of this capstone design project. 
1. main.cpp, OCR.cpp, OCR.h, Plate.cpp Plate.h, Cars.zip and OCR-TestImage.zip is the first part to detect the possible car plate. 
    You can run car plate detection in main function. 
    You can change the comment content in che main.cpp to do plate character segmentation. 
2. svmtrain.cpp and SVM.zip are the second part which used to do rectangle classification.
3. Character_Recognition.m and 00.zip are the third part which used to do the character character recognition.
